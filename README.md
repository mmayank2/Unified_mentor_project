# Netflix 
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate data cleaning and visualization skills using a Netflix dataset. The dataset includes content from 2008 to 2021, with content dating back as far as 1925.
Data Preparation and Cleaning
1.
Importing Libraries: Python libraries like pandas, numpy, and seaborn were imported to handle data manipulation and visualization.
2.
Handling Null Values: No null values were found in the dataset, simplifying the cleaning process.
3.
Duplicate Removal: Three duplicate movie titles were identified and removed.
4.
Splitting Duration: The 'duration' column was split into two: 'Duration1' for movie length in minutes and 'Seasons1' for TV show seasons.
5.
Breaking Listed Genres: The 'listed_in' column was split into multiple genre columns to enhance visualization and analysis of Netflix content by genre.
